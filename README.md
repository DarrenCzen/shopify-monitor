Extremely lightweight and efficient restock and new item monitor for various Shopify based sites. Extremely fast & proxy support.

This monitor is more advanced than most monitors on the market currently that are PAID. I decided to code this monitor because
I was bored and thought I could help. Unlike other monitors on GitHub this acutally catches restocks and new items.
